# Circle-Surface-Calculator
This JavaScript function, named "surface," calculates the surface area of a circle based on user input of the radius. It prompts the user to enter the radius, computes the area using the formula πr², and then returns the result along with a descriptive message. The function is invoked and the result is logged to the console using console.log.
